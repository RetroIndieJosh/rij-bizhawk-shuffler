# RIJ BizHawk Shuffler
With additional plugins by [Retro Indie Josh](retroindiejosh.itch.io)

## TODO - chat-swap
- visual indicator "LOCKED" when in lockdown

## Ideas
- swap to a specific game (is this possible?), like !swap Mega Man 2
- prettier transitions for messages on screen (Josh's Countdown, swapper name for YouTube swap)
- stats tracking for YouTube swap, like # of swaps per viewer
- link to YouTube API so we can tell users when they need to donate more to unlock commands
    - if we're using the API we can also simplify by not writing to a file first
- add minimum required donation to youtube-chat commands

- somehow track !swaps and limit to $X/swap in donations
