# RIJ BizHawk Shuffler
With additional plugins by [Retro Indie Josh](retroindiejosh.itch.io)

## TODO - chat-swap
- visual indicator "LOCKED" when in lockdown

## Ideas
- swap to a specific game (is this possible?), like !swap Mega Man 2
- prettier transitions for messages on screen (Josh's Countdown, swapper name for YouTube swap)
- stats tracking for YouTube swap, like # of swaps per viewer
- link to YouTube API so we can tell users when they need to donate more to unlock commands
- add minimum required donation to youtube-chat commands

- regularly update the extra_life output (run alongside chat logger in infinite loop?)
- combine extra_life and chat_logger to run together since they're dependent
    - only one yaml to configure, we can have top-level extra-life and youtube keys
